# Description
- This game, designed for two players, the game board size is 9x9, and consists of 9 standard sub-boards 3x3 of the classic TicTacToe game. 
- The first player marks his moves with the X character, and the second player with the O character.
- Players place their character alternately, in free spaces on the board, with another limitation:
   - The position in the sub-board that a player selects defines the sub-board in which the next player will have to play. 
   - For example, if the first player place a character in the top right corner of one of the sub-boards, the next player will have to place a character at the top left      sub-board, unless there arent free spaces in this sub-board (in which case he will be able to select a sub-board as he wishes).
- To win in a particular sub-board, you must create a straight sequence (vertical, balanced or diagonal).
- You can continue playing in a sub-board even after one of the players has won it (in the available places), unlike the description on the link above.
- To win in all the game, must create a straight sequence of 3 wins in sub-boards, as illustrated in the link.
